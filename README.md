# Tinder-Relationship-Prediction_Classfication
In the rapidly evolving digital age, online dating platforms have emerged as a popular means of finding romantic partners. Among these platforms, Tinder stands out due to its widespread use and unique matching algorithm. However, with the growing popularity of such platforms, understanding the factors that contribute to successful relationships has become a crucial area of study. Our project, "Tinder Relationship Prediction: A Classification Problem," aims to address this by predicting the likelihood of a successful relationship based on various user attributes and interactions on Tinder.

Problem Statement
The primary goal of this project is to determine if a relationship will be successful on Tinder. We define "success" based on specific criteria derived from user feedback and interactions. 

The key factors we consider include:
1.Medium of Usage: Whether users are accessing Tinder via mobile or web.
2.Name of Universities: Educational background, as indicated by the universities users have attended.
3.User Response to Tinder Usage: How users answer the question "Do you use Tinder?".
4.Count of Tinder Matches: The number of matches a user has obtained.
5.Percentage of Tinder Matches to Total Swipes: The efficiency or success rate of obtaining matches.

By analyzing these variables, we aim to develop a robust predictive model that can accurately classify the success of a relationship initiated on Tinder.

Methodology
Our approach to solving this classification problem involves several key steps: data collection and preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, statistical testing, model development, and evaluation.

Data Collection and Preprocessing:
The foundation of any data-driven project is the quality and relevance of the data collected. For this project, we gathered a diverse dataset comprising user responses and interaction metrics on Tinder. The data included both categorical and numerical variables, necessitating a comprehensive preprocessing phase.
1.Handling Missing Values: Missing data can significantly impact model performance. We employed various strategies such as imputation and removal of rows/columns with excessive missing values.
2.Normalizing Numerical Features: To ensure that numerical features are on a comparable scale, we normalized them using techniques such as Min-Max Scaling.
3.Encoding Categorical Variables: Categorical variables, such as university names and user responses, were encoded using one-hot encoding and label encoding to facilitate their use in machine learning models.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
EDA is critical for understanding the underlying patterns and distributions within the data. We conducted a thorough analysis to uncover key insights that could guide our model development.
1.Data Visualization: We used histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to visualize the distribution of numerical variables and identify any outliers or anomalies.
2.Correlation Analysis: By examining the correlations between variables, we identified potential predictors of relationship success. For instance, we observed that higher match counts and percentages were positively correlated with successful relationships.
3.Feature Engineering: Based on our findings, we created new features that could enhance model performance. For example, we derived a feature representing the ratio of matches to total swipes.

Statistical Testing:
To validate the significance of our findings, we performed statistical tests. One of the key tests we conducted was the 2-sample T-test, which helped us examine the relationship between Tinder match percentages and successful relationships.
1. 2-sample T-test: This test revealed a p-value of 0.0059, significantly below the threshold of 0.05. Consequently, we rejected the null hypothesis, confirming that there is a statistically significant relationship between match percentages and relationship success.

Model Development:
With the insights gained from EDA and statistical testing, we proceeded to develop several classification models. Our goal was to identify the model that best predicts relationship success.
1.Logistic Regression: A popular and interpretable model, logistic regression served as our baseline model. It provided a reasonable accuracy but was outperformed by other models.
2.K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): KNN emerged as the best-performing model, achieving an accuracy score of 82.4%. This model leverages the similarity between data points to make predictions, making it particularly suitable for our dataset.
3.Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA): Although LDA did not perform as well as KNN, it provided valuable insights into the linear separability of the classes in our data.

Model Evaluation:
Evaluating model performance is crucial for ensuring reliability and robustness. We used several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, to assess our models.
1.Confusion Matrix: By analyzing confusion matrices, we identified the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives for each model. This helped us understand the types of errors our models were making.
2.Classification Reports: Detailed classification reports provided additional insights into precision, recall, and F1-score, allowing us to fine-tune our models for better performance.

Key Findings
Our analysis and modeling efforts yielded several significant findings:
1.Higher Match Counts and Percentages Correlate with Success:
Users with higher numbers of matches and higher match rates were more likely to report successful relationships. This aligns with the intuitive understanding that more matches provide better opportunities for meaningful connections.

Model Accuracy:
The KNN model demonstrated the highest accuracy in predicting successful relationships, making it the preferred model for this classification task. Its performance was significantly better than logistic regression and LDA, highlighting the importance of considering non-linear relationships in the data.

Significant Variables:
Variables such as the medium of usage, the name of the university, and the number of matches were critical predictors of relationship success. These findings suggest that both demographic factors and user engagement metrics play vital roles in determining relationship outcomes on Tinder.

Conclusion
The "Tinder Relationship Prediction: A Classification Problem" project successfully developed a predictive model that can classify the likelihood of a relationship's success on Tinder with substantial accuracy. Our approach, which combined thorough data preprocessing, insightful exploratory analysis, rigorous statistical testing, and robust model development, exemplifies the application of data science and machine learning in solving real-world social problems.

The implications of our findings are manifold:
1.Enhancing User Experience:
Dating platforms like Tinder can leverage our model to provide personalized recommendations and improve matchmaking algorithms. By understanding the factors that contribute to successful relationships, these platforms can enhance user satisfaction and retention.

2.Guiding User Behavior:
Our findings can help users optimize their profiles and interactions to increase their chances of finding successful relationships. For instance, users might focus on improving their match rates or engaging with the platform more effectively.

3.Future Research:
This project lays the groundwork for future research in online dating dynamics. Further studies could explore additional variables, such as user behavior over time, messaging patterns, and profile attributes, to refine predictive models and gain deeper insights into relationship success.

In conclusion, this project not only contributes to the academic understanding of online dating dynamics but also has practical applications for enhancing user experiences on dating platforms. It showcases the power of predictive analytics in the digital era and highlights the potential of data science to solve complex social challenges.
